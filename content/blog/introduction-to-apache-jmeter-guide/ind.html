As we all know Apache JMeter is a pure JAVA based open source tool to measure performance and to test
functional behaviour of the applications. It can be used as a load testing tool for analyzing and measuring the performance of a variety of services, with a focus on web applications.
It is used to simulate a heavy load on a server, group of servers, network or object to test its strength or to analyze overall performance under different load conditions.
